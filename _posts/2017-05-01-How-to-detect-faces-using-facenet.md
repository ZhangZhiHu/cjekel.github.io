This post will show how to detect faces using the [facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) library, as it is not exactly clear from the wiki on how to use functions within the library. I've found that the facial detection implmenation in facenet to be much better than the standard [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) haarcascade frontalface detection method.

The [facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet) library is a TensorFlow implementation of the [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) paper. You can download some of the pre-trained models, which have an accuracy of 0.993 with the LFW dataset. This accuracy is certainly impressive. So what are you waiting for, go clone and fork this library!

<div>
{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet.git
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

And now install.
<div>
{% highlight bash %}
$ cd facenet
$ sudo python setup.py install
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

First you must be sure that you have all have  installed all of the Python requirements which are: tensorflow==1.0, scipy, scikit-learn, opencv-python, h5py, matplotlib, Pillow,  requests, and psutil. I'm running the latest tensorflow=1.1.0-rc2 and facenet appears to be working with no problems. Now you should validate facenet using the LFW dataset to verify that your installation is working  properly. You can follow [these](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/wiki/Validate-on-lfw) instructions.

The facenet library uses a pre-trained [MTCNN](https://kpzhang93.github.io/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment/index.html) to detect faces. This appears to be a really good facial detection implmenation. With my particular dataset, the MTCNN facial detection implementation is working much better than the standard haarcascade frontalface detection typically done with OpenCV.

Here is a simple script to detect faces using the facenet implmenation:
<div>
{% highlight python %}
#   import facenet libraires
from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function

from scipy import misc
import tensorflow as tf
import os
import align.detect_face

#  import other libraries
import cv2

#   setup facenet parameters
gpu_memory_fraction = 1.0
minsize = 50 # minimum size of face
threshold = [ 0.6, 0.7, 0.7 ]  # three steps's threshold
factor = 0.709 # scale factor

#   fetch images
image_dir = 'presidents/'

#   create a list of your images
images = os.listdir(image_dir)

#   Start code from facenet/src/compare.py
print('Creating networks and loading parameters')
with tf.Graph().as_default():
    gpu_options = tf.GPUOptions(
        per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=gpu_memory_fraction)
    sess = tf.Session(config=tf.ConfigProto(gpu_options=gpu_options,
        log_device_placement=False))
    with sess.as_default():
        pnet, rnet, onet = align.detect_face.create_mtcnn(sess, None)
#   end code from facenet/src/compare.py  

    for i in images:
        img = misc.imread(os.path.expanduser(image_dir + i))
        #   run detect_face from the facenet library
        bounding_boxes, _ = align.detect_face.detect_face(
                img, minsize, pnet,
                rnet, onet, threshold, factor)

        #   for each box
        for (x1, y1, x2, y2, acc) in bounding_boxes:
            w = x2-x1
            h = y2-y1
            #   plot the box using cv2
            cv2.rectangle(img,(int(x1),int(y1)),(int(x1+w),
                int(y1+h)),(255,0,0),2)
            print ('Accuracy score', acc)
        #   save a new file with the boxed face
        cv2.imwrite('faceBoxed'+i, img)
        #   show the boxed face
        cv2.imshow('facenet is cool', img)
        print('Press any key to advance to the next image')
        cv2.waitKey(0)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

The long lines may mess up your code if you copy and paste from the above source. So I recommend that you download [faceDetect.py](https://github.com/cjekel/cjekel.github.io/blob/master/assets/2017-05-01/faceDetect.py) and the [presdients](https://github.com/cjekel/cjekel.github.io/blob/master/assets/2017-05-01/presidents/) folder of images from [here](https://github.com/cjekel/cjekel.github.io/blob/master/assets/2017-05-01/).

Now just run faceDetect.py to watch the MTCNN box the location of faces around the sample presidents.

<div>
{% highlight bash %}
$ python faceDetect.py
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

The code should create the following images.
