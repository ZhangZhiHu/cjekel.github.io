#About Me#
I'm a semi-pro traveler, burrito aficionado, Python scripter, and problem solver. Currently I'm pursuing a Master's Degree in Mechanical Engineering at Stellenbosch University. Some of my interests include:<ul><li>numerical modeling</li>  

<li>high performance computing</li>  

<li>non-linear finite element analysis</li>  

<li>material models</li>  

<li>inflatable structures</li>
</ul>  

My technical skill set, determination, and easy going personality all combine to make me one exceptional team player. Send me an email at {{site.email}} and let's work together on some thought-provoking problems.
